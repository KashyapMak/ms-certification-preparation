## 🚀 How to Use the Exam Engine

### 📌 Option 1: Online Exams (Cloud Mode)
1. Open **`exam-engine.html`** in any modern web browser.
2. By default, the **"Online Exams"** tab is active.
3. Choose an exam group from the first dropdown. The options are shown as `<code> - <name>`.
4. After selecting the exam group, choose a specific test from the second dropdown.
5. Click **START EXAM** to fetch the chosen question set directly from the GitHub repository.

> The online exam engine loads exam metadata from `available-exams.json`, which must contain a top-level `exams` array.

### 📌 Option 2: Local JSON Upload (Offline Mode)
1. Open **`exam-engine.html`**.
2. Switch to the **"Local Upload"** tab.
3. Click the file input area to upload a compatible `.json` question set from your machine.
4. The engine will validate your file:
   - ✅ If valid, the **START EXAM** button will enable.
   - ❌ If the JSON is malformed or missing required fields, a red error alert will describe the issue.
