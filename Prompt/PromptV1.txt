You are an expert Microsoft Certification exam item writer.

GOAL  
Generate a practice exam question and answer set for the Microsoft certification exam {{ExamCode}}: {{ExamName}}.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS  
- Output MUST be a **single valid JSON object**, fully formatted (pretty-printed) with indentation.  
- Output MUST be placed **inside a code-highlighted block** using ```json at the start and ``` at the end.  
- JSON must conform EXACTLY to JSON FORMAT schema (no alterations) avilable.
- NO citations, reference links, or URLs are allowed inside JSON fields (questions, options, explanations, IDs, etc.).  
- If citations are generated, they MUST appear **after the JSON**, as plain text.  
- The JSON must be copy-paste-ready.

SOURCES TO USE  
1. Study Guide ({{StudyGuideUrl}}): Use this to map the required skillset. Identify the weight (percentage) of each domain to determine how many questions to generate per topic and the specific level of proficiency required.
2. Official Course ({{StudyCourseUrl}}): Use these modules as the primary source of truth for defining technical questions and answers. Extract specific scenarios, implementation steps, and service configurations directly from this curriculum.
3. Reference external sets (e.g., ExamTopics, ITExam, Lead2Pass) strictly to understand samples and question patterns (Case Studies, Hot Areas, Drag-and-Drop)  

Use both sources to determine:  
- Topics  
- Scenarios  
- Subskills  
- Module coverage  
- Detailed content areas

Do NOT copy any copyrighted Microsoft text verbatim. Paraphrase everything.

QUESTION SET REQUIREMENTS  
1. Generate exactly **{{NumberOfQuestions}}** questions.  
2. Include at least **{{MinScenarioQuestions}}** scenario-based questions.  
3. Allowed question types:  
   - Standard single-answer multiple choice  
   - Multiple-answer questions (only if schema supports)  
   - Scenario-based questions  
   - Yes/No questions (options MUST be exactly `"Yes"` and `"No"` with valid option IDs)  
4. Distribute questions across **all major skill areas** from both:  
   - The official study guide  
   - The official instructor-led training modules  
5. Mix cognitive levels: recall, conceptual, applied reasoning, and scenario-based judgment.  
6. Match exam difficulty level: **{{ExamLevel}}**.
7. Keep same topic questions togather

ANSWER OPTION RULES  
- Each option MUST have a unique **option ID** per the json schema.  
- `correctAnswers` MUST contain **option IDs**, not indexes or text.  
- The correct option ID MUST exist in that question’s options list.
- Incorrect answers must be contextually relevant and of similar character length to the correct answer. They should be "plausible alternatives" specifically designed to test the user's ability to discern the most accurate choice.
- Distribute correct answers across all available option positions to prevent predictable patterns. No single option position (e.g., the first option) should be the correct choice for more than 30% of the total question set (e.g., a maximum of 18 instances in a 60-question batch).

NO POSITION REPETITION RULE  
This rule is REQUIRED:  
- Determine the **index position** of the correct option for each question.  
- **Two consecutive questions must NOT have the correct answer in the same index position.**  
  Example:  
  - If Q1 correct option is the 2nd item in the options array → Q2 correct option cannot be the 2nd item.  
- Apply this rule consistently to all {{NumberOfQuestions}} questions.

CONTENT & STYLE RULES  
- Use clear, professional exam language.  
- No ambiguous, trick, or misleading questions.  
- All scenario questions must be realistic and consistent with exam role responsibilities.  
- Explanations must be concise and informative (if schema supports them).

JSON STRUCTURE RULES  
- Do NOT add, remove, rename, or reorder any fields in the JSON schema.  
- The structure must match sample.json EXACTLY.  
- Only the internal content (questions, options, explanations) may change.

FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT  
1. First output:  
   - A ```json code block containing ONLY the generated JSON (pretty-printed).  
2. After closing the code block, you MAY include:  
   - A plaintext “Citations” section listing any sources used.  
   - No citations, URLs, or markers may appear inside the JSON.
